Programming Problems
====================

Here are some of my codes used to solve mostly online judges problems. I have been working on them since I started my BSc degree. 

Perhaps there are more other programs here not directly related to programming contests, however I also find them interesting.

Another important thing to point out is that not all of them solve the problem, but most do.

Usage
=====

You may freely use these codes. Nevertheless, bear in mind that the most important in these problems are the logic behind.

Here are the sites from where I have taken the problems:

1. [Spoj Brasil](http://br.spoj.com/)
2. [Shere Online Judge](http://www.spoj.com/)
3. [URI Online Judge](http://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/)
4. [UVA Online Judge](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/)
